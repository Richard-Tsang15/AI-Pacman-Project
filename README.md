# AI-Pacman-Project

The Pac-Man project, developed for CS 781, focuses on deepening the understanding of key AI concepts, including informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, it employs depth-first, breadth-first, and A* search algorithms for optimal pathfinding. These concepts have real-world applications in areas such as machine learning and natural language processing.
